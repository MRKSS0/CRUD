# Crud Operation in ExpressJS

I made a site for CRUD operations. (Because I was bored, lol.)
It's made with JS and BootStrap together!

## Documentation [How to use it?]

When you downloaded it, just go to in folder and run



```bash
  npm i
```

Then configure .env (Just read) and run

```bash
  node index.js
```

And enjoy!
